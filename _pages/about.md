Hi, there! I am Beste and I am a master's student in computer science at ETH Zurich, specializing in data management systems and machine intelligence. I am passionate about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software development. I have several internship experiences in the industry, including a software engineering internship at Google. I am fluent in languages like C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I have experience using frameworks like React, Spring, and Django. I also have experience as a part-time software engineer during my bachelor's degree, which I earned from Bilkent University in Turkey.
