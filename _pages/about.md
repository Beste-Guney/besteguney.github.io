I am a master's student in computer science at ETH Zurich, specializing in data management systems and machine intelligence. I am passionate about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software development. I have several internship experiences in the industry, including a software engineering internship at Google. I am fluent in languages like C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I have experience using frameworks like React, Spring, and Django. I also have experience as a part-time software engineer during my bachelor's degree, which I earned from Bilkent University in Turkey.

I am Beste Guney. I am 22 years old. I love cooking [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
